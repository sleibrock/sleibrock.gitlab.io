(h1 "Fake Audio Sucks")

(p "I have a pair of headphones from HyperX, which add the capability to transform audio into (in their terms) \"7.1 Surround Sound Audio\". Is this a good thing, or a bad thing, and what implications does this have? Let's found out.")


(h2 "How Audio Works")

(p "Audio is the result of when air is pushed around with pressure that when the air hits our ears, we interpret it as something called 'sound'. In a vacuum with no moving parts, there is absolutely zero sound, but in our real world, with wind, traffic, people yelling, there's sound all around us.")

(p "Sound is a non-discrete entity which we can then turn into a discrete entity by using analog-to-digital devices, which can sample audio for a period of time and create discrete samplings of audio pressure over a select interval. If you record a whoopie cushion on your phone, you just converted an analog signal input into a digital signal output. Welcome to the digital age.")

(p "Naturally, humans have two hears (in the best case possible). So we designed something called 'headphones', equipped with miniature speakers that will do their best to recreate audio from an analog signal. The analog signal is created from a digital-to-analog converter, mostly our computers or phones or MP3 players, so we can hear what was recorded. Because there's two speakers, we can have our audio recorded as either a stereo sound, where there's two channels representing either side of your head, or a mono sound output, meaning both sides will have the same signal output.")

(p "So it might sound like a ramble but where am I getting with this? For decades we stored audio in only two channels, representing left and right ear outputs. Later on, we discovered the power of multiple-channel audio formats, such as 5.1 Surround Sound. This was a very niche way of storing audio, and was used mostly for theatrical recordings of movies that recorded their movies with 5.1 audio support (they produced the movie with multiple sound tracks as opposed to just stereo).
